# Automate a Daily Task

I automated the task I perform almost everyday after my system boots up. The script opens geeksforgeeks practice portal and my email in the browser along with spotify and of course setting the volume level according the preferences.

## Instructions to execute the script
- Have python (python3) and python-pip installed in the machine
- Install the required packages using the following command
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Execute the script
  ```
  python main.py
  ```
