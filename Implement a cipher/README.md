# Implement a cipher

A cipher is an encryption algorithm that encrypts a message by shifting each letter in the message by a certain number of letters. This is an implementation of Caesar's Cipher.

# Steps to execute
- Have python installed in the environment
- Execute the python script
  ```
  python main.py
  ```

# Example Output
```
Enter the plaintext: This is a message
Enter the shift: 7
The ciphertext is: Aopzupzuhutlzzhnl
